1,1.0,Delayed by 12hours on flight into…,"Delayed by 12hours on flight into Toronto from Heathrow, ground staff helpful and apologetic at Heathrow. Eventually received compensation for this delay. Our internal flight between Toronto and Vancouver was cancelled altogether, we were informed by email that we may get a flight in two days by which time our holiday would have been ruined. The ground staff in Toronto were very unhelpful and in some cases quite rude. No hotel or food offered. Our agent eventually got us seats on a flight much later that day.On our internal flight and the flight home we were not seated together. This was our forth attempt at this holiday due to covid and ill heath, completely blighted by our experience with Air Canada. I will never travel Air Canada again."
2,1.0,Air Canada Hates Handicapped Passengers,"Summary: A Third-World Airline run by a bunch of people who operate with impunity.Here are the details.  In September, my handicapped partner traveled to from the US to YUL on Air Canada.  At YUL she was taken off the plane in a wheelchair and then abandoned at the top of the jet-way.  Eventually, she had to walk about 1 km to customs.  The customs agent was so horrified that he escorted her to curbside to ground transportation.We filed a complaint about prejudice against handicapped passengers with the Canadian Transportation Authority (filing 23-47443). Of course they have not done anything either.  All of these people need to be 'named and shamed' because otherwise they will do nothing.  ""We don't care because we don't have to,"" seems to be the prevailing attitude."
3,1.0,Worst airline imaginable,Connecting flight delayed 24 hours. Stuck in foreign city with no hotel or anything then after months of trying to get any compensation whatsoever they reject it and give me nothing. Genuinely evil airline. Avoid if at all possible honestly.
4,1.0,Never Again,"When you think of a destination wedding in tandem with hiring a travel agent, you think booking a one-week getaway for 60 people would be pretty easy, right? Not with Air Canada Vacations.Not only did they consistently ignore our requests, they left them for so long the options we wanted were sold out. I’m talking 3 months. Any adjustments we requested had an average turnaround time of 3 months. 3 months to select a seat or change a room. Yikes. No direct flights (apparently) so you’re doing red eyes to a connecting morning flight meaning 8 hours on a plane - to get to Cancun from Canada. You also are not allowed to upgrade your seats when booking this trip through the travel agent-ACV so that would have been nice to know ahead of time. You’d think if we’re offering you more money, you’d jump at it. Nope, turned us down and didn’t care to try. Then they cancel one of the 3 flights that was bringing some of the wedding guests down, meaning 20 people now have to spend what was supposed to be their first night on a hot getaway, at an airport hotel with only $40 vouchers for food at the AIRPORT. Then you get on the airplane, where the stewardesses come around to offer juice or drinks at an extra expense (obviously never a problem paying for this), yet won’t even put a pot of coffee on for the economy class. Instead the three stewardesses sit at the back of the plane on their phones in vacant customer seats, while the one in business class collects garbage and handles, well, business class. I’d also like to note that the ONE time the economy stewardesses came around, they rammed the cart into this poor gentleman’s leg and then BLAMED HIM for having it too far into the aisle. How about you offer some customer service, look where you’re going and ask him to move his leg instead of running into him?Then you arrive at the airport in Mexico looking for the transportation that was arranged for your group, and not only can you not locate them, but once you do (20 minutes later) they then tell you they may not be able to fit you all. After deciding they can, they let you sit on the bus for over an hour after guilt tripping you about wanting to purchase yourself a beer…because “they have some for you on the bus”. Well I could have had 3 in the time it took us to get going. Ok, so now we’re done with the arrival and they drop us off at the hotel. Great! And then fast-forward to a week later when the shuttle is to pick you up to return to the airport - no big deal it was only 35 minutes late. At least the one good thing I can say is the host and driver of this shuttle were wonderful to deal with. Finally a positive. The return flights home were a tad better, with the one from Cancun to Toronto having the best service stewardess-wise. This was the only flight of four that I actually felt they cared to give some customer service. All in all, Air Canada Vacations is the worst airline I have ever used, and I will never book with them in the future, nor will many of my family or friends. This was the most horrendous organization & execution of a trip I’ve ever seen.WestJet flyer for life, especially now."
5,1.0,Air canada is the worse airline in…,"Air canada is the worse airline in history with no empathy at all. I am an international student here in Fredericton and after paying an extra luggage fee on my bag, air canada has still not found my bag or refunded my immediate expenses. It has been 48 days and no words from them . I keep calling and hearing the same thing. I would like help. Please anyone with information on who to contact ?"
6,1.0,My experience with Air Canada was…,"My experience with Air Canada was nothing short of a complete disaster. I wouldn't wish this airline on my worst enemy. To start, our departure was delayed by a mind-boggling two hours, and the reason? Apparently, the gate wasn't even available. So there we sat, like cattle, twiddling our thumbs, and wondering if this was some kind of cruel joke.But oh, the delays didn't stop there. No, they continued throughout the flight. It was as if Air Canada had a personal vendetta against punctuality. The flight attendants must have thought they were on vacation too, as they seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than addressing the frustrated passengers.I'd like to say that the in-flight experience made up for it, but that would be a lie. The seats were about as comfortable as a park bench, and the in-flight entertainment was laughable at best. It's safe to say that my next flight won't be booked with Air Canada. If you value your time and sanity, steer clear of this airline."
7,1.0,I had a check in problem in Dublin…,I had a check in problem in Dublin Airport. The AC agent  took personal responsibility for the problem and had it resolved after working on it for an hour with AC help desk.  In 4 decades of travel I have not experienced a higher level of customers care.

Not so much). And the flight was 1 hour late...."
10,1.0,"Never fly AirCanada, no matter the price","My dad booked a flight with them, where the system literally fused together his first and last name such that airport authorities denied him to fly. They couldn't fix their issue and gave him a miserable reimbursement although he lost 3000+ dollars because of the other connections and the new flight he had to book. Never fly AirCanada, their mistakes can ruin your holidays."
11,1.0,Delayed by 38 hours from Manchester to…,Delayed by 38 hours from Manchester to Toronto.Poor communication and lack information. Difficult to contact. Changed pre-paid for seats on both journeys. Ground staff at Toronto airport were rude and unhelpful.Never travel with Air Canada again.
12,1.0,Hopeless,"Hopeless. Were flying Sydney to Vancouver business class 27th April 2023 and the incoming aircraft got grounded due to bird strike. Flight delayed two days. We got given accommodation and cheap meals in a low class hotel (Ibis) near Sydney Airport for two nights. Our travel agent failed to cancel our prepaid accommodation in Vancouver. We have been trying to claim that cost on travel insurance, but Air Canada refuses to answer our emails to Customer Service asking for the necessary documentation proving flight cancellation (APT, the travel agent, have also been hopeless, referring us to the ""fine print"" in their conditions). I have tried calling Air Canada (from Australia) with no result. Numerous emails not answered. Never again. An airline with regular flights to Australia would have had replacement aircraft available much sooner."
13,1.0,What a shower,What a shower! We booked to fly and return to Canada over 12 months ago. Despite requests we were not seated together on check in on both flights and 1 internal flight. Automated check in baggage drop was difficult as  many kiosks did not work. At Toronto we tried 5 kiosks until the 6th worked. Boarding at Vancouver was difficult as the staff erected zone lanes but to space to queue - one large scrum . CA wont be my first choise again.
14,1.0,Extremely disappointing service from Air Canada,"1. Lost baggage x 22. Narrow / uncomfortable seats3. Rushed breakfast service, food literally thrown at us4. Ground staff that lied to our faces regarding lost luggage5. Contact options regarding lost baggage were useless as no one picked up the call.

15,1.0,Great Service - Needs UK Support and More,"I have to say the service onboard my first Air Canada flight (EDI-YYZ - 1st October 2023) was rather pleasant, the onboard crew were super friendly and efficient with everything but their flight management team (landslide crew) were HORRENDOUS as they had us stand in a queue for 1 hour at the gate claiming it would only be a few minutes to board the flight, and we left late due to this and the failure to check the aircraft at the stand.The other thing I wasn't happy with was the lack of UK contact options and offers, everything was Canada Based which for those outside Canada it would cost a lot to call. The AeroPlan offers for members outside of the UK are zero.I've had to change my return flight to this coming Friday (13th October) and I am hoping there to be no issues as experienced in Edinburgh and for the check in crew to be on time..."

This was said very loudly so the whole plane could hear! They also bullied passengers by telling them they must when eating pull their mask up while chewing their food! In the galley they were sitting laughing about this while eating and drinking without masks! Totally nasty peaple!

To over booking flights. Non existent support. Impossible to contact from the UK. Non response to attempts to resolve. AVOID AVOID AVOID"
1,1.0,AVOID AVOID AVOID,AVOID AVOID AVOIDAir Canada have to be the worst company I have had the misfortune to interact with in years. Their policy of overbooking flights and cancelling at the last minute is grunt appalling. I had a flight for elderly parents visiting Canada from the UK cancelled twice. Once the week before then the second time when they were on their way for the airport. Zero support provided. Truly horrendous experience and arrogant company. Do not use this company or prepare to be treated way worse than you can begin to imagine. Deserve zero stars.
2,1.0,Air Canada flights  worest carrier,"We had Air Canada flights via an agent to London to Calgary, Vancouver to Toronto and back to UK, to say this was stressful with this lot is an underestimate.  Booking seats together was the biggest problem.   We struggled and we told they will do this at the gate, just before you board. Yes, we were given seats but split up, my wife being 10 or more rows behind me, told them I had a heart condition and I more comfortable if she was close to me. Nobody cared, they just passed us on and said best ask the passengers when in the plane, if they will move. they just don’t care! Also, two out to the three flights were delayed, we sat on the tarmac on Toronto for an hour before the plane docked to allow us off. And coming back to London the flight was delayed by 6 hours. They offered us a 15 Dollar voucher as compensation. I will never fly this carrier again."
3,1.0,Outstanding ! We traveled on Air Canada flights back…,We traveled on Air Canada flights back and forth to Portugal thru toronto.The flights and service were among the best we ever had in our 60 years of flying.Outstanding is all we can say.
5,2.0,NOT recommend!,"Like the rest of the reviews. NOT recommend fly company to use. First fly cancelled. Then rebooked to another fly, which were delayed, so we missed our connecting fly. Rebooked to another flight the next day, which we declined. So the rebooked us to a different airplane company. Bad information all the way. We paid for extra legspace, and for the first bagage x2. They messed that up also, and wanted to charge us again for the bagage. Want to give minus 5 stars, if that was possible."
6,1.0,Air Canada! Never Again!,"Never again will we fly Air Canada! We booked, confirmed & our seats were allocated in advance. Yet Air Canada would not let us on the flight. Claiming some nonsense about possible “credit card fraud”. Which is rubbish because our payment was DEBIT CC and we knew funds had gone thru weeks previously.  “If” that had been the case they did not even bother to call or let us know.They refused to let us board, charged a “cancellation fee” and said we could re book for tomorrow but it would be much more expensive! Air Canada check in desk said “we should apply for a refund” which proves tickets were definitely paid for - we also had evidence.They gave our seats to “standby” passengers.What a Scam Air Canada! Ashamed and Embarrassed this is our Canadian flagship!"
7,1.0,0/10,"I am sad that I cannot give 0. 1 star shouldn't be the lowest rate, and Air Canada does not deserve a single star.I think the best word to describe this airline is ""incompetency"".I didn't know anything about this airline before actually coming to visit Montreal. After hours of delays, lost baggages, no real explanations, now I can say it safely: do not use this airline if you have other options. If you want to throw your money away there are easier ways to do it."
8,1.0,Do not book with this airline whatever you do,Do not book with this airline! Cancelled our flight london to Toronto with 7 days to go and didn’t rebook us onto a new flight. Thousands of hard earned and saved pounds gone into this trip only to have to frantically book a new flight one week before and of course we could no longer afford to go direct. Chasing for compensation currently. This is all made worse by the fact their customer service team is unreachable. Avoid air Canada like the plague worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline!
9,1.0,Senile Paula at Boston,"Paula who works for Air Canada in Boston is the rudest and most unprofessional person I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. She couldn’t work her computer system, was extremely rude to us and her colleagues. At one point she got herself so flustered she told me to move away from the desk or she would get the police! I head my three year old son on my shoulders at the time. The whole time she was verbally aggressive and even when we chose to go to a difference server she continued mouthing off across the checkin desks."
10,1.0,"A Culinary Journey at 35,000 Feet with Air Canada!","My voyage with Air Canada was nothing short of a luxurious experience. I had the privilege of flying business class, and I must say, the standards of comfort and hospitality were impeccable.The stars of the journey were undoubtedly the gourmet meals served on board. The menu boasted a variety of exquisite dishes, each prepared to perfection, catering to a palette of international tastes. The quality and presentation of the food were on par with fine dining restaurants, making each meal an event to look forward to.The service provided by the flight attendants was exemplary. Their attention to detail, professionalism, and genuine care enriched the dining experience manifold. They were attentive without being intrusive, ensuring that all my needs were met promptly and with a smile.The comfortable seating and spacious business class cabin allowed for a relaxed and enjoyable flight experience. The seats reclined to a fully flat position, making it easy to rest between the gourmet meals.Air Canada's commitment to delivering a top-notch flying experience was evident in every aspect of the journey. The seamless blend of fine dining and exceptional service at cruising altitude set a new benchmark for what one can expect in business class air travel.I wholeheartedly recommend Air Canada for anyone seeking a premium flying experience. The remarkable food and superior service in their business class are well worth the investment"
12,1.0,Terrible company,"Terrible company. Do not let you amend flight details at all. Wanted to change flight details 2 weeks before, even offered to cancel the first part of my trip but if I did that they would automatically cancel the second leg… Only way to change things are, “Imminent death”."
13,1.0,“Toll free” number is actually an international call from a mobile,"Air Canada has only one option for calling them from the U.K., a “toll-free” number which actually counts as an international call from mobile phones. How many people ring them from landlines???!!! How does the average person in the U.K. contact them without racking up HUGE phone bills?"
14,1.0,"Air Canada, simply the worst!","Air Canada has topped the list of the worst customer service I have ever experienced in the Northern hemisphere. They delayed offloading the entire airplane's luggage by 2 whole hours, were extremely rude when they finally appeared and locked themselves in their office. I missed my connection because of the delays with luggage and they turned around and said it wasn't their problem. Why are these people even in this business?"
15,1.0,A nightmare of an airline,"A nightmare of an airline. I have paid them thousands for a multi city trip. Pay for leg room seats, seats cancelled. Constant itinerary changes. And today, notified that I have been ""re accommodated"" onto a new internal flight from Toronto that takes off an hour before my first flight lands in Canada! No email address, no one answers the phone and they will not allow calls to customer service from a cell phone. In 2023. Avoid this clown show AT ALL COSTS!! Disgusting service!"
16,1.0,Do not use Air Canada !,Do not use Air Canada !! I have been unable to contact them and my booking agent tells me they will only speak to me so they can't add luggage ! Its ridiculous never had this problem with any other airline    I call the free 0800 uk number get through to a Canadian auto response asking for my Aeroplan membership number which I'm not a member of Worst service ever stay away from Air Canada
17,1.0,I’m Flying to Toronto next week and I…,"I’m Flying to Toronto next week and I purposely paid over 170 pounds for a row of 4 seats so my wife and two young children (2 and 3) could all sit next to each other. Today,I received an email saying there was a seat change on my booking and they’ve since moved my 3 year old son to a different row without my consent or approval ( I got an automated email). Needless to say I am appalled and extremely worried by this! I’ll never ever book or fly with them again after this trip and willEnsure to share my experience on other social media platforms! The airline should be ashamed!!"
18,1.0,Air Canada changed my flight times to…,"Air Canada changed my flight times to Canada. Gave me 5 days to contact them if I wanted to make alterations to my schedule but no contact number???. Web chat a useless robot, email pointless (upto 45 days wait time), customer service telephone number 0800 66992222 does not work.Who knows how to actually contact this company ??"
19,1.0,Terrible flight delays and ignoring customer service,"The flight Toronto-Calgary was delayed by over 5.5 hours. I filed the complaint and got a refund granted. That was 3 months ago, and air Canada still hasn’t paid me the refund. Moreover they haven’t responded to any of my multiple emails. I’m turning the case to debt collectors."
0,0.0,Horrible customer service,"Horrible customer service. Air Canada cancelled my flight citing their fraud dept flagging my purchase as potentially fraudulent. Didn't even bother to contact me. And when I called today to ask what happened and explain that the purchase is legit they refused to rebook my flight at the same rate saying I must rebook a new seat at $270 higher fare. Ridiculous. They refused to budge or allow me to elevate my complaint up the chain. No apology, no sympathy, no nothing. Useless! Zero customer service present at Air Canada"
1,1.0,Terrible experience with Air Canada,Terrible experience with Air Canada. Boarding at Heathrow like a rugby scrum following hour delay. SEVEN HOURS DELAY on return flight from Vancouver with no explanation and food voucher only when I insisted. Four different people ( not employed by Air Canada) said Air Canada was an awful company and Canadians avoided travelling with them. Air Canada has now said no compensation is due using reasons they seem to regularly employ to avoid entitled payment. I am appealing but the wait for can be long due to the number of complaints against this company. It was my first visit to Canada and it is a pity that this beautiful country is let down by a company flying the Canadian flag.
2,1.0,Delays and unfriendly crew,"Flew from Heathrow to Vancouver and from Calgary to Heathrow, both flights delayed, on board some of the crew were good at their job and friendly, the ones in our section were not, no smiles or hellos or please/thankyous, obviously in the wrong jobNot sure air Canada would be my 1st choice for future flights"
3,2.0,My worst flight ever,"My worst flight ever. After having 3 hours delay they rebooked me to another longer flight on the last row seat. The cabin crew came and asked me to go and sit on my original seat i said this was my seat, she gave me resting b*tch face and said “interesting” and she goes away. She comes back two minutes later and ask for my boardingpass, i show her the pass and she gave me the same face going away. Due to a medical emergency issue i had to change my seat which i had no problem with it but the way she comes telling me was again very rude. So i tell them and then she keeps ignoring me giving me breakfast or taking the garbage away. This was my last flight ever with Air Canada i rather pay more and fly with Air transat or other companies."
4,1.0,"Air Canada 🇨🇦 from a loyal business client who flew 96,000 miles last year","Air Canada 🇨🇦 I have always supported them and used for my business for years; however, today I received notice that my Premium Economy flight (I had already applied eupgrade to buisness) from Montreal to Malaga via Zurich has been changed to basic economy. How can an airline treat clients like this, they stated; ""We're sorry your itinerary has changed due to unexpected business or operational constraints on our planned flight schedule and we have automatically rebooked you on another flight. ""Thanks AC From a 75k Elite client who flew 96,000 miles last year"
5,1.0,flight cancelled - and rebooked from another airport 400 miles away,"flight cancelled - crew had timed out, apparently(why? there was no delay? weather was perfect?)'automatically' rebooked for the next day (but not notified) and then discovered that they had changed the departure airport from BWI to Charlotte (~400 miles away?!). Wait time for customer service more than 60 minutes. 3 check-in agents unable to help. finally after 8 hours waiting at BWI was able to get on the afternoon flight. what is wrong with this airline?"
6,1.0,Disappointing Service,"On arrival to our destination, our flight was delayed 3 hours. Our return flight from Charlottetown to Toronto was cancelled do to mechanical problems. We were automatically booked onto another flight but that flight was for the following day. We were not able to contact a service agent and had to travel to the airport to make alternate arrangements. This was our first and last time flying Air Canada."
7,1.0,Worst customer service ever,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced - and that's an already low bar. Takes weeks to get a voucher processed, website is badly organised and keeps crashing, and it is literally impossible to speak to an agent on the phone. Ever. The flight itself is okay, but no better than vastly cheaper airlines with better customer service (i.e. any customer service at all)."
8,1.0,Avoid like the plague,"Booked flights early to ensure an stress-free travel experience to a family reunion in Canada at the end of the year, and they just keep cancelling different legs of our flights, except weirdly those flights still exist. My guess is they can make more money by cancelling these legs of our booking and selling to someone else. Now we have to rebook, except they never answer their phones. A combined 4+ hours of waiting on hold in the last two weeks and never getting through despite calling at various times of the day/night. Their hold music is infuriating. I’m a Canadian living overseas and am absolutely ashamed of this company. This is the worst airline I have ever flown/dealt with (travelling globally with a variety of airlines), and sadly has been this way for 30+ years. That the Canadian government continues to support this shoddy company escapes me - they deserve a “zero stars” rating."
9,1.0,Bad business and NO customer service at all!,"Air Canada has delayed 3 of my 4 flights and my last flight home was cancelled leaving me stranded in Toronto with no flight home.  They simply do not care for their customers and do not deserve their business!  I urge everyone to boycott this company, as they have horrible customer service and horrible ratings for bad business and a history of delays and cancellations.  I will NEVER travel with Air Canada again and certainly not travel through Toronto either…their airport is terrible!"

11,1.0,Almost 1 year since our dreadful trip…,"Almost 1 year since our dreadful trip with AirCanada, Vancouver/Toronto/BWI, still no attempt to answer my e-mails or refund any costs for the cancelled flight (as we boarded). Left for hours in the customer service queue at the airport before they closed the desk and left us stranded in Toronto airport.Not an isolated incident, my daughter flew twice with them from Vancouver, and similarly had her flights cancelled at the last minute and left to find a hotel.Returning to Canada/USA this year but we will not be using this airline.I would urge other passengers to listen to the reviews here, I wish we had.  £1000 out of pocket as they did not provide an alternative flight for us/hotels/meals/taxi's."
12,1.0,Terrible costumer service,"Air Canada delayed my connecting flight by 11 hours, which forced me to stay a night and book a hotel; I asked them to cover that fee since it was their responsibily and they refused. They provided zero compensation and just told me that they would not be giving any feedback on the issue. If you want proper costumer service, stay away. I would absolutely not recommend flying with them."
13,1.0,"Air Canada, We're Not Happy Until You're Not Happy!","Air Canada gets worse everytime we fly with them. Also watched a head flight attendant tell a mother her 5 year old didn't need to wear his seatbelt during take off. Horrible service, AC does not make it convenient or enjoyable. But thanks to them were buying a motorhome!!"
14,1.0,Paid 86 euros for chairs we didn't get,"Paid 86 euros for chairs we didn't get, instead got chairs not even next to eachother. Customer service wasn't of any help and gave false information."
15,1.0,Be warned.   A very dodgy company.,"Be warned.  A very dodgy company.  They lost 4 bags Calgary to Heathrow priority business class.  The same man came round to check in the oversized bag as well.  We have confirmation it never left Calgary.  Air Canads refuse to call me back and state they cannot make outgoing calls.  The only way I got this basic reply was by tweeting.   There is a hell of a lot of 'lost' baggage. That is impossible, so there is something sinister going on.   I have flown very regularly all my life so understand how things work.  The reviews say everything.  An airline that refuses to engage with clients is VERY Dangerous."
16,1.0,I had read bad reviews of this company,"I had read bad reviews of this company, but its price and hours seemed ideal. I never would have. Five days before the Madrid-Calgary flight, our stopover in Toronto was delayed one day. We managed to get our flight changed to another via Dusseldorf, but when the day of checking arrives it is impossible for us to do so. As this company does not have a telephone for the public in Spain, we called one that we found on the web, which turned out to be a scam (they wanted to charge us an extra 1,200 euros). Finally, they had to show up at the airport at five in the morning to check-in.The return trip was also exciting: both in Calgary and Toronto our boarding gates were changed twice, in the second case after announcing it over the loudspeakers five times.Let everyone draw their own conclusions."
17,2.0,I hate Air Canada,I paid several thousand dollars for a flight from Sydney Australia to New York US. For that money Air Canada made me pay for food for the 5-hour leg between Vancouver and NY!The reason was they told me that it was an internal flight. Haha - Air Canada thinks that Canada is part of the US!Sorry Canadians your country doesn't exist.On top of this customer service was very poor. No one told me I needed a visa just to transit through Canada (weird) until I got to the airport and nearly missed my flight from having to apply for it.The food was minimal and staff weren't interested in the passengers.Buying extra legroom was a waste of money because staff just use extra space as a thoroughfare and a place to store their trolleys.And then you have to pay you $5 for the useless $0.50 pair of earphones in order to listen the inflight entertainment.I will now be damaging the Air Canada brand as much as I can as the opportunities arise.
18,1.0,Reserved seat changed so party split up.,"Paid to reserve seats together, but changed with no reason given. Refunded my seat reservation fee, but not my wife's.40+ minutes on hold to helpline and they were not able to tell me anything or do anything."
19,1.0,Hello again,"Hello again, Air Canada here is your next 1* review as you have failed to respond to my email. It’s a shame I can’t leave 0*. So you deny that my arrival was delayed by 24 hours, and therefore that I’m entitled to any compensation, AND YET you’ve already paid me the overnight expenses! Come on, wake up. Then pay up.Does this company not care that 82% of its reviews on here are 1*?"
0,0.0,I wish I read the reviews before…,"I wish I read the reviews before booking. What an old barge of an aeroplane! The seats are very narrow and have an uncomfortable curvature that hunches you forward, possibly the worst seats that I have experienced on a flight.Make sure you leave an extra TWO HOURS at the destination to get your luggage (+oversided) bags back... Staff on the boarding side seemed reasonably nice."
1,2.0,1 star is too high,"1 star is too high. Easily the WORST experience of airline customer service. I understand flights get cancelled, get delayed. I don’t understand how a company can still be in business when it treats its customers as badly as my father and I were treated this past 31 hours. NEVER AGAIN."
2,1.0,I wish I could give no stars,"I wish I could give no stars. Still trying to follow up on my claim status but the # given is for all enquiries and none of the choices direct you to claim status. Does anyone know a phone # for people trying to follow up on a claim status? As a previous customer said ""A national embarrassment""."
3,1.0,Don't travel air canada,Planes were always running  late I'm taking about 1.5hrs late and one time on tar Mac then off to motel.Food terrible  and not enough  rounds.Last one we had breakfast  1.5 before  landing and they were rushing  it no kind slow listening  service it was rushed.   They should serve a bit earlier  so there not rushing.  Not many options  in drinks.Staff not friendly  and girl  are not tidy compare to emirates   air hostess
4,2.0,"Worst company EVER - BAGGAGE MISSING , TOTALLY UNREACHABLE","Worst company EVER. Air Fawlty Towers. First they could not check us in at Schiphol, Amsterdam for almost 2 hours due to computer problems. Then they could not board us because they OVERBOOKED. This caused a massive 1hour delay. Ground employees were literally in tears from stress. In the end we could go on board.. Then when we arrived at Miami airport our BAGGAGE was missing. After 3 days we received a message they located the suitcases. Now the Delivery Company is totally unreachable, we received a phonenumber that doesn't even work. What a terrible company, Service BELOW ZERO. WE WANT OUR BAGGAGE!!!   18/07 Update: Another 4 days have passed; Still no sign of our Baggage : not even a SINGLE REPLY anymore from this company!! Delivery phonenumber is out of service / AC phone at Miami Desk is never answered and has a full answeringmachine, so impossible to even leave a message there as well.."
5,1.0,Horrific customer service,I’d leave 0 if I could. Flight was delayed due to maintenance. We were told this at the gate and via email. Compensation was denied claiming it was actually due to security (clearly just avoiding comp). Customer service has refused to acknowledge the issue and misinformation and has told me the ticket is closed. Absolutely horrific customer service. Will never fly AC again.
6,1.0,HORRIBLE,My daughter and boyfriend just flew Air Canada and was a nightmare. A mutiny at a Canadian Airport. Hundreds of upset customers who were turned away for hotel credits and offered pitiful $10 food vouchers. Flights delayed leading to missing connecting flights and now they lost their luggage amounting to over $3000 worth of clothing. My husband and I were booking a vacation to Canada that would be using Air Canada. I just emailed my travel agent saying I will not use that airline.
7,1.0,We travelled to UK on 11 September 2022…,"We travelled to UK on 11 September 2022 by air Canada We didn’t had any problem with air Canada .Though meals ( Asian vegetarian meal)were not up to our expectations,but not bad .On back journey to Canada on 01 October 22 from Uk with stopover ar Calgary ,was pleasant with better meals I don’t understand why people are writing bad reviews?Again today I have booked one way ticket from India to Vancouver for my granddaughter who is a student. I don’t feel there will be any problem."

10,1.0,Air Canada,"What I liked:- comfortable seats in economy class- nice, modern cabin, especially on the A330, the 777 feels more cramped- Very good in-flight-entertainment- good catering-friendly, attentive service- affordable pricingWhat I did not like:- nerve-wrecking check-in at Frankfurt airport, 2 hours of standing in line, rude staff. Due to the long lines, the flights are almost always delayed, often by 1 or 2 hours. The check-in agents just shrugged and said it was always this bad. Nobody bothers to change anything about this deficit.- On the flight back there was another 2h delay. Check-in was fast and efficient but then we had to wait for ages."
13,1.0,I am on my flight back from Boston,"I am on my flight back from Boston, and there is a delay of more than three hours. Asking the customer service for meal voucher compensation as the Air Canada delay compensation policy mentioned; ridiculously the customer service called someone and the answer was, probably you guys deserve it but we are advised not to give it. I am speechless….the 10 dollar voucher won’t save our lives, but it is a sign of taking care for your customers, which obviously it is not Air Canada intention. Ridiculously they are saying is bad weather in Toronto, which seems not to be true too, Toronto has nice weather today, so Air Canada is shamelessly a liar too."
14,1.0,Why have a phone number for customer…,"Why have a phone number for customer service, when all you do is point back to the website? Why have a chat on the website, when all you get is a bot that points you to the website?  I need a human to resolve my issue, but it appears that none work in your customer service department."
15,1.0,Brutal Service,"Air Canada “customer service” agents are poorly trained to deal with customers, and clearly have zero patience. My bag has been missing for 4 days and all I’ve received is empty promises. It took all of 30 seconds before this agent I talked to rudely shoed me off the phone. Air Canada your service is useless and brutally frustrating to deal with, an experience I will not relive. Save me the generic apology response and use that time to go find my bag and actually resolve the issue."
16,1.0,Delay you by 3 hours with infrequent…,"Delay you by 3 hours with infrequent updates, and when they do they present it like good news- as if they haven’t just wasted hours of your life. Also make you watch heinous ads before they take off for whatever reason.Previous to this I had repeated mixed messages about whether to pick up and recheck my bag or not- so lost my booked lounge time to waiting to see if my bag turned up on the carousel or not. P.s. They obviously use the back of the carriage as a crèche, so avoid booking those seats if you’re sensitive to noise."
17,1.0,Better than the Rest,Sometimes mediocre is actually pretty good in this industry.  I fly for vacations several times per year.  Even though AC is often more expensive...I enjoy the experience of security knowing that my flight is going to take place.  There is slightly more leg room and slightly better service.  Way to go Air Canada...you may not be amazing but you are better than the rest.
19,1.0,Disgusted!,"Honestly, I was such a happy repeat customer till today. My bag has been delayed 4 days…finally got it back and majority of my things are missing. Carton of cigarettes, clothing very VERY sentimental expensive perfume!!I will never fly them again unless they reimburse me for all the damages and hassle I’ve gone thru!"
0,0.0,I would give no stars if I could,"I would give no stars if I could.  My itinerary was changed by Air Canada.  They sent me an email giving me the option to cancel, but, the link they tell you to use doesn't work in the UK, and the online 'chat' is useless. There is no easy way to get in touch with these people. I have tried social media, but no reply.  Non existent customer service!!"
1,1.0,Left my baby on plane with no food for 4 hours to then cancel flight…,"I left a very serious formal complaint regarding the lack of care my 2 year old baby was provided on board their flight.I sent This complaint via both their online form and email. I chased them a dozen times to respond and did not get a single response. There is absolutely zero complaint procedure with this airline, they simple file complaints in the bin…. Flight AC 945"
2,1.0,Freezing passengers in the dark are good passengers,"After our uncomfortable last Air Canada flight in March, this time I wanted to book another airline. I booked a Lufthansa flight via Opodo, just to find out after booking that both flights would be - again - Air Canada. The seats are way too narrow. Three grownup persons next to each other have their shoulders pressed against each other. This makes eating the bad tasting food filled with chemicals even more troublesome. Sitting next to the corridor, I got pressed against the corridor from the shoulder of my husband, and bumped into on the corridor by flight attendants or other passengers passing by. I constantly got pushed or bumped or stepped on my foot. Above me was a long line of ventilation slots. From there, icy cold air kept dropping down on me. I told a flight attendant that this was way too cold and she said they'd rather not have it too warm for the passengers. I pulled the blanket over my head and caught a cold anyway. After lunch all the shutters went down and the plane got dark. I asked last time why they did that, and was told that this keeps passengers more quiet. Finally all the flight attendants were the most unfriendly of any airline I ever flew with. Why two stars? The plane started from Frankfurt as scheduled and arrived in Toronto in time."
3,2.0,Jean Marc client rep at the Las Vegas…,"Jean Marc client rep at the Las Vegas airport went over and beyond to find 7 lights for myself and my friends return tickets to Vancouver Island after our original flights were cancelled last minute.  He was polite,  very apologetic.  If it wasn’t for his full support we would have had to find hotels and come. Ack a day late to our children.  Thank you Jean Marc for caring."
5,1.0,Beware…you don't get what you pay for!!!,"On a recent trip from ATL to Casablanca, via a plane change in Montreal, I had booked a full business class ticket ong with my two traveling companions. I was seated in economy to Montreal 🤬. One of my companions, a handicapped guy, was seated in economy all the way from Montreal to Casablanca when he had purchased and had a confirmed seat in Business!! Plus, his luggage didn't catch up to him til our final day 11 in Casablanca. The flight attendants were rather disengaged, some super aloof... This was the first and last time EVER on this very substandard airline."
6,1.0,"Waste of money, terrible service","We paid more to have extra leg room, but the end seat of the 3 in particular was so narrow it was incredibly uncomfortable for a 9hr flight. I’m not a big person at 13st, but was still touching both sides of the seat. Anyone 14st or above would have no chance!! Staff were not interested, and provided the worst in flight service I’ve experienced in my life, very rushed service for an hour or so, then they all disappear for 4 hrs or more. Then another rushed half hour and that’s your lot. Pretty dreadful in truth."
7,1.0,worst ever!,worst ever!I had issues with bagages delayed 18 days (received it 3 days before leaving my holidays.No one is truly helping you to get a refund for this.The website is a real nigthmare to use they always ask for an incident report number that they never gave to me.You arrive at your destination using united airlines (which is really bad too) so you can only complain to them.I'll never book a fligth with them again!
8,1.0,I've waited for 1 hour and I don't know…,"I've waited for 1 hour and I don't know why people work in customer service when they can't give customer service. Is started talking to this agent and she started yelling at me, she didn't even listen what I wanted to talk about. I have tried calling them again and again so that I can talk to at least one good agent who actually knows how to provide customer service. All these uneducated agents make you feel like a fool and then all you can do is cut the call. I hope AIR CANADA educate their employees before they put them behind the phones or whoever don't give a damn about customers and working drom homes."
9,1.0,Terrible service and arrogant staff The…,"Terrible service and arrogant staff The kind of bad service you have to look for a long time😡😡. On the way to the USA. Stopover in Brussels and onward transit in Montreal(AC833 at 10:00). At the gate, we and other passengers are asked to fill out a very long electronic visa application. No help to be had from the staff. We are not allowed to board until we receive a confirmation email. We get that, the plane is still at the gate, ""but unfortunately boarding has just finished"". So there we stand completely disillusioned, and the staff are totally indifferent😡. Have to go with unfinished business and lost tickets. Now had to buy new ones. Will never travel with AirCanada again 😡"
10,1.0,"Flights changed, connector flight now non existent","I booked flights with Air Canada directly after a previous negative experience using an online travel agency.The itinerary has since been changed and my connecting flight from Montreal to Vancouver has disappeared, leaving me with a 12 hr layover in Montreal and directions to ""change airports""... before my next flight from Vancouver. Absolutely disgraceful, and now no one at customer service is answering the phone."
11,1.0,"Absolute incompetent, appalling service.",Absolutely useless incompetents.  Changed my flight.  Won’t offer sensible options.  Trying to rebook a BA / air canada flight out of Manchester.  They are only offering me air canada only options.  They don’t fly out of Manchester.  So… impossible.  Utter useless
12,1.0,They canceled our flight 36 hours…,They canceled our flight 36 hours before takeoff. I was able to find an alternative BUT it will not let me edit anything and says I need to do  it with customer service. Been on hold now for 2 hours...All I want to do is confirm all is ok with the updated booking and confirm a few other things that I SHOULD be able to do online.....
13,1.0,Poor maintenance practices - safety issues,"Our flight from IAH to YYZ took off on time, but halfway through the flight, we turned back around because the deicing system was not working. We were made to wait in the hot plane without water on the Houston runway until we could deboard. I filed for compensation but was told since this was a ""safety issue"" instead of a routine maintenance issue, they would not compensate me. Seriously? It's not a surprise Canada is cold in the winter, they should have checked before takeoff there was malfunctioning deicing equipment. This practice of skirting compensation claims only incentivizes the company to skip out on routine maintenance, because if anything happens in the sky, they don't have to pay you! In my opinion, it's only a matter of time before one of their planes crashes due to poor maintenance practices and kills everyone."
14,1.0,Air Canada: A National Embarrassment,"Air Canada cancelled my flight and provided no alternative to get me to my destination.  Air Canada provided a number to call but did not answer when repeated calls were made but rather relied on an automated voice to gather information about me, my reason for calling, and my flight but not provide me information or options to get me to my destination or how Air Canada would compensate me for their breach of contract.  Neither Air Canada’s telephone service nor their webpage provided an adequate way to effectively submit a complaint."
15,1.0,AIR CANADA - ANY AIRLINE BUT !!,"When considering them as our NATIONAL carrier they are an absolute embarrassment !! from customer service, to quality of meals (or lack of), to their definition of 'premium economy' (compared to WESTJET),  to just how the heck do you miss putting FORTY pieces of luggage on to a plane ?? isn't that what the bar codes are for & why did it take 55 hours to fix sooooo IF you have any other choice - TAKE IT !!!"

17,1.0,Don’t bother flying Air Canada until mask mandate is rescinded,"Flew Air Canada from London to Montreal and back. The thing that kills me is that they still have a mask mandate on the way back despite no restrictions in the uk. Whilst I appreciate that this may be a sick Federal mandate, I will no longer fly this airline whilst the crazy mask mandate is in place. The uk has dispensed with any kind of mandate since last February without any ill effects. To force people to wear a useless face covering is insulting and uncomfortable. However the staff was lovely both on the way there and back."
18,2.0,I would rate a zero if possible,"I would rate a zero if possible. Constant delays with 15 to 30 mins intervals on the first day 4 different times. They board the flight only to later tell everyone they are no travelling because the pilot has already flown twice and cannot fly again. Meanwhile automated messages about delays lie and blame it on the weather. Automated rebooking for 2 days later with stops. A non-stop flight had been purchased so we didn't accept. Managed to get a flight the following day at the same time and they have already delayed it 3 times, 2 days in a row of this nonsense! What an embarrassment of an airline. They mess up and you have to jump through hoops to figure out a solution and then demand compensation. They should really be ashamed to be in business with this level of service.I dare any other industry to operate the way airlines do and survive. They have to be held accountable and be made to pay for the terrible service they provide. They constantly prove they do not care about people or providing a good service."

0,0.0,First experience of International Flying on 9 and 21 May 2023,"I flew with Air Canada recently to Calgary from LHR and returned. On both flights the crew were amazing, kind,helpful and very efficient.  The Maple Leaf Lounge at LHR was disappointing, seats were all scruffy and worn at the edges, everything was dusty. The food did not look appetising so I opted for a sandwich, the staff were good.  The ladies toilet was very clean. The Maple Leaf Lounge at Calgary was super clean, really good selection of food and on site chef preparing fresh. 5 star!  The ladies toilet was dirty and not been cleaned for sometime. Thankyou to the crew of Air Canada I had really great flight experiences. Also the Checking In Staff at Calgary went above and beyond to be helpful and make sure our experience with Air Canada was good.  They deserve a real good reward for total dedication to their job."
2,1.0,London to Mumbai: unfriendly and disrepair.,"Flew them from London to Mumbai and back, Economy on the way out and Premium Economy on the way back. Normally Canadians have a reputation for being friendly - yet somehow Air Canada seems to have found the exceptions and made them crew. The entire flight there was very little politeness or friendliness. Premium Economy was a real let down - and is not worth the money. All you get is a slightly nicer seat - but there is no better service, nor food.Finally the toilet seat in economy had a crack in it; they had used tape to cover it. Which is fine if it had ""just happened"" but it really looks like it had been in that kind of disrepair for a while."

The plane has a wide range of free entertainment, it made those hours pass quickly. I appreciate that they ask the passengers to keep their mask on during the whole flight. We just had to wait for about three hours when they changed the plane for an ""unforeseen maintenance issue"". Personally, I'm glad they changed the plane if there was an issue, I only expected they offer us at least something to drink or eat in the meantime. Anyway I will chose them again on my next flight."
6,1.0,Appalling,"I travelled with Air Canada on the 27th/28th June. The flights were delayed and the entertainment system did not work on either flight. I arrived in the UK without my suitcases. One was delivered five days later, the other TEN weeks later with no apology. I have still not received the repayment of the baggage fee paid (which they commit to for delayed bags). Their Indian call centre only read from a script and cannot give any information despite many calls and it is impossible to get in contact with anyone else. Appalling customer service."
7,1.0,March 18  Part 1,"March 18, Nanaimo to Montreal. Missed connection in Vancouver due to fact, as an invalid, I needed assistance going one plane to the next. No through flights to Montreal, only Toronto- Montreal. Arri Bags lost on this tripving in Toronto, same problem with connecting flight. No one to push the wheelchair in reasonable time. Bags were lost on the way out but found in one day. Lost on return trip. Damaged."

9,1.0,Avoid. Poor quality. Delayed. Poor after flight customer care,Flew To Calgary in the summer.  Very badly delayed.  They told us it was due to safety issues and offered a voucher as goodwill. We questioned the safety issues and asked for evidence since then TOTAL RADIO SILENCE and all communication ignored.  The after flight service is appalling
10,1.0,Team Jenny + Jane Save Our New Years Plans!,"We had some confusion with tickets that were booked with Aeroplan Points. Tickets were not issued, and I failed to notice until less than 24 hours before the flight.  This also happened to be Dec 29th for a Dec 30th Flight. Needless to say we were very Panicked and we were supported by a Jane T @ Aircanada Toronto, and a Jenny From Aeroplan who was in Vancouver. Both Ladies went above and beyond to resolve our issue, and even though it was partly my mistake for not double-checking the app until the day before they graciously took over an hour to make it right and get us on our original flights. Nice work, Aeroplan + AirCanada! Go Team Jenny+Jane!"

I called in and spoke to Dipal Parmar and she was able to fix the new itinerary to my specifications."
16,1.0,"as an airline its ok, the rest is garbage","as an airline its ok. they have planes. you buy seats.as a customer service experience this unadulterated piece of excretoir is laughable. even with aeroplan and all the fancy shmancy reward programs they just dont take your call lol. You cant cancel some bookings online they tell you to call, you call they tell you to go hyuck yourself.Biggest joke is "" wait time is longer than usual"" No its not, your usual wait time is ALWAYS 1-2 hours lol. its not longer than usual. it is the the usual. just hire more ppl for hyuuck sakes"
17,1.0,Tried booking online for an hour,"Tried booking online for an hour. Kept getting error messages. I ring up and funny old thing the flight is suddenly £100 more! SORT YOUR WEBSITE OUT! If your website is not working – match the price on the phone. What a wasted evening... Thanks AirCanadaEDIT: tried again the next day, even after the AirCanada Customer service said it was now more expensive, went through at the better rate next day.EDIT II: Had a great couple of flights with AirCanada and loved their statement on the unscientific restrictions AirCanada and their customers had to endure."
19,1.0,This company speculate in making money…,"This company speculate in making money on its “mistakes”. It lures you in  under your assumption that it is a serious company. But at the end it’ll cost you.I bought a ticket where the app changed my booking with a month. I didn’t notice until I had payed. I immediately tried to rebook. Didn’t work unless I bought a more expensive ticket ;) service center - couldn’t get through. It dropped my call as there were more than 2 hours lineup.Ended up costing me the double. So I’ll go to the competition from now on. Airlines think they’re immune, because of our lack of loyalty to anything but low prices. Be careful with Air Canada.It cannot be a coincidence that they year after year have so many mistakes."
0,0.0,AIR Canada cancelled my flight from…,"AIR Canada cancelled my flight from London to Canada up to 5 times until it was no longer possible for me to fly again. Now they have refused to refund my flight ticket. The worst part is they stopped replying my messages. Sometimes I even wonder if I have been scammed by scammers who stop replying after a while, but no, this is AIR Canada. I was supposed to be the best man at my best friends wedding on a weekend in September 2022. Because I work Monday to Friday, I booked my flight for Friday evening so that I can arrived in time on Saturday to attend the wedding. I was about boarding the plane on Friday night when they first cancelled the flight and took us to a hotel for another flight the following morning. The morning flight was cancelled twice and was further cancelled 3 times during the day, making it impossible for me to attend the wedding as there was no way i would have arrived on time. So I had to cancel my ticket and returned home. Since October last year I have been asking for a refund which they said is being processed. Up till today, I haven’t received my refund and they have stopped responding to me. I have sent several emails with no response. Please I need help from anyone who can help."
1,1.0,Lost luggage/Delayed,Lost luggageWe travelled on 12th june from Seattle to Canada. AND it is almost 21 days they couldn not  trace our baggage and not even update us with the last scanning place of tag number. The only option is to mail them and we will not get any response from them too.
2,1.0,Terrible Airline,"Terrible. Flight was changed by 1.25 hours meaning we'll miss our connecting flight. Email said we can request a refund by calling. Called the help center and they were rude and said there was nothing they could do as it was less than 3h change. Was a frequent flyer, will never be flying air canada again"
3,1.0,Air Canada Christmas disaster,"What went wrong this time? Everything. Started off with a 4 hour delay, missed our connecting flight which led to two other connecting flights the day after. Lost a suitcase (4’th day of the vacation and it’s still lost) and a day of the vacation. Tried calling the airline with no answer. Still missing my suitcase!"
4,1.0,Excellent Business Class experience,Flew from Heathrow to Calgary and back from Vancouver Sept/October this year. Business class was excellent in all respects - attentive and friendly cabin crew. My wife is a Coeliac and her dietary requirements were met perfectly.

The aircraft is dated where I can't change my phone with an HDMI plug. I upgraded my economy class seat and was promised more space. On top of that, they lost my luggage!!! I asked the boarding desk staff to ensure my luggage is in the plane that I was flying with before my flight. This moron told me not to worry and it's in the plane. With that being said, I will no longer fly with F#%^ING Air Canada again and would rather opt for an airline carrier from a 3rd world country! What a nightmare of a vacation that I just had! 🤬"
8,1.0,I couldn't recommend this airline.,"After cancelling my flight from Seattle to Vancouver, it threw out all my other flights to Australia. I waited 8 hours in Vancouver airport for an Air Canada flight which was not my original airline. It was a full flight and my aisle seat had a pull up entertainment screen which got knocked down to the ground at least 30 times during the flight. Half those times it was the staff that knocked it down with there bodies walking past. One lady knocked it down 6 times and looked back at me and never a word of apology.Then arriving in Sydney my backpack was all torn and a strap completely broke and some spices and items removed from the top of my bag. Really poor effort Air Canada. Really disappointing as I like your country very much, but a really bad airline."

Delayed Baggage","Arrived in Edmonton for the first time , then being handed a card to file missing luggage form with the agent very un apologetic trying to justify and normalise this unacceptable practice of the airline.

Also, my customer service experience reporting this to people whom I need to spell everything that I say with no active listening apologising unemphatically like reading it from a script.Definitely my last with this airline ,and surely will tell everyone on how the situation was mishandled . I’m still waiting for my baggage until now and I’m only here in canada for 9 days. What a horrible experience. I am very regretful to have booked this flight.

12,1.0,Air Incompetence,"In July I had the misfortune that I used Air Canada to enter and leave Quebec. On leaving our flight from Quebec to Toronto was delayed and as a result we missed our next flight. We waited over 12 hours in Toronto for our flight AC8749 to leave. Our gate changed 5 times. Our flight AC8749 did not arrive into Charlotte (NOT DULLES IAD which it was originally scheduled) until just after 12 midnight on 7/18 and therefore missed our flight to Charleston SC. Additionally in Toronto I was told there would be someone from Air Canada to help us with a room for the night because we knew we going to miss our next flight.  There was nobody from Air Canada there to meet us. We were supposed to fly out on an American Airlines plane to Charleston but it was gone. The person closing the door was a tarmac person and had no idea or even the phone number for customer service. Given it was already about 12:30am we decided we had to sleep on the chairs until the morning. We got another flight on American Airlines AA1657 in the morning OF 7/18 to Charleston (CHS). Canada has a system if you complain to the airline you should get a response. I did file a complaint with Air Canada and this is the response I go.""We reviewed your case for flight AC8445 YVR - YXT, on 2023/07/17, and found that the length of delay was under 3 hours. Unfortunately, this means you are not eligible for compensation."" Are you kidding me? I immediately responded to this misaccuracy and received no response. So I'm getting my ounce of revenge because I will absolutely NEVER use Air Canada again."

I will not fly with them in the future."
14,1.0,My family booking in premium economy…,"My family booking in premium economy was assigned the middle seat each person in different rows, months in advance. When contacted the staff couldn’t move anyone around as apparently they don’t have the details to look at what other people address travelling solo, or as a group etc to best look after everyone. They suggested I ask the person next to me on the plane to swap so I could sit with my kid. They got upset and disconnected the call when I said that was unacceptable and please escalate the request to a manager because that information whilst not available to me is absolutely available to air Canada staff somewhere."

16,1.0,"flight cancellations, lost bagagge, no communication","I was scheduled to fly to Copenhagen at 4:30pm and told to go to airport 3 hours early. I arrived and advised on the board my flight had been cancelled with no notification. My flight was rescheduled 8 hours later to Frankfurt with no connection to my final destination. And no flights to Copenhagen for over 24 hours. I was advised to use an “air Canada reservation phone” which I waited for 2 hours to get ahold of an attendent.I was rerouted on a flight to Mumbai with a layover on Heathrow. This flight was delayed 2 hours and I missed my connection and had to wait an additional 8 hours in the airport, which I was generously given a 10 pound voucher. I verified with staff on 3 separate occasions that my bags were on the next flight due to all this chaotic rerouting. I was assured they were there.I arrived in Copenhagen 28 hours after I departed and lo and behold my bags are now missing. 2 cancellations. 1 missed connection. Bags lost"
